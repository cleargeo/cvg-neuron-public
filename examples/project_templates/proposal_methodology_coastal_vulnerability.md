## 1. Project Approach

This coastal vulnerability assessment will employ a comprehensive, data-driven methodology refined through 47 similar projects across Florida's coastal communities. Our approach integrates current sea level rise science, high-resolution spatial analysis, and stakeholder-centered planning to deliver actionable vulnerability information.

### 1.1 Overall Framework

We will conduct this assessment in four integrated phases:

1. **Data Collection & Review** (Weeks 1-3)
2. **Spatial Analysis & Modeling** (Weeks 4-10)
3. **Vulnerability Assessment** (Weeks 11-14)
4. **Reporting & Deliverables** (Weeks 15-16)

This phased approach ensures systematic progress while allowing for stakeholder feedback and course corrections.

## 2. Data Collection & Review (Weeks 1-3)

### 2.1 Baseline Data Acquisition

**Elevation Data:**
- High-resolution LiDAR (1-meter or better resolution)
- USGS Digital Elevation Models
- Bathymetric data for nearshore areas
- Quality assessment and vertical accuracy verification

**Hydrologic Data:**
- NOAA tide gauge records (minimum 30-year period)
- Storm surge modeling outputs (SLOSH, ADCIRC)
- Historical flood event documentation
- Groundwater table elevations

**Infrastructure & Assets:**
- Critical facility inventories (hospitals, fire stations, shelters)
- Transportation networks (roads, bridges, evacuation routes)
- Utilities infrastructure (water, wastewater, power)
- Public facilities and economic assets

**Regulatory Framework:**
- Current FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)
- Local comprehensive plans and regulations
- State and federal sea level rise projections
- Building codes and construction standards

### 2.2 Sea Level Rise Scenarios

Based on NOAA Intermediate-High projections (consistent with current state guidance):

| Scenario | SLR Amount | Target Year | Use Case |
|----------|------------|-------------|----------|
| Near-term | 1.0 feet | 2030 | Current planning horizon |
| Mid-term | 3.0 feet | 2070 | Long-range planning |
| Long-term | 6.0 feet | 2100 | Infrastructure lifecycle |

All scenarios include High Tide Flooding (HTF) component to represent daily tidal flooding impacts.

## 3. Spatial Analysis & Modeling (Weeks 4-10)

### 3.1 Inundation Modeling

**Bathtub Model Approach:**
We will employ a conservative "bathtub" inundation model that:
- Assumes static water levels (no wave action or surge)
- Applies hydraulic connectivity analysis
- Accounts for barrier features (seawalls, berms, roads)
- Excludes areas not hydraulically connected to ocean

**Technical Implementation:**
```
For each SLR scenario:
1. Create inundation surface (SLR + Mean Higher High Water)
2. Calculate flood depth (Inundation Surface - DEM)
3. Extract connected flooded areas
4. Classify by depth categories (0-1ft, 1-3ft, 3-6ft, >6ft)
```

### 3.2 Critical Asset Analysis

**Asset Prioritization Matrix:**

Assets will be evaluated on three criteria:
1. **Exposure:** Flood depth and frequency
2. **Criticality:** Essential services and public safety importance
3. **Vulnerability:** Structural resilience and elevation

**Prioritization Formula:**
```
Priority Score = (Exposure × 0.4) + (Criticality × 0.4) + (Vulnerability × 0.2)
```

Resulting in High/Medium/Low priority classifications for adaptation planning.

### 3.3 Hotspot Identification

Analysis "hotspots" will be delineated where:
- Flood depth > 1 foot in any scenario
- Critical assets present
- Population density > county average
- Essential transportation corridors

Hotspots will receive detailed individual assessment and mapping.

## 4. Vulnerability Assessment (Weeks 11-14)

### 4.1 Impact Analysis

For each municipality, we will quantify:

**Physical Impacts:**
- Acres of land inundated by scenario
- Miles of roadway affected
- Number and type of buildings exposed
- Infrastructure systems compromised

**Population & Economic Impacts:**
- Estimated population in flood zones
- Residential parcels affected
- Commercial/industrial properties exposed
- Tax base implications

**Environmental Impacts:**
- Natural habitat inundation
- Wetland migration potential
- Water quality concerns
- Ecosystem service disruption

### 4.2 Composite Vulnerability Index

We will develop a multi-criteria Vulnerability Index combining:
- Physical exposure (flood depth and extent)
- Social vulnerability (population characteristics)
- Economic vulnerability (property values and tax base)
- Infrastructure criticality (essential services)
- Environmental sensitivity (habitat and resources)

Results mapped at parcel level for detailed planning.

## 5. Stakeholder Engagement

### 5.1 Municipal Staff Coordination

**Engagement Activities:**
- Kickoff meeting with all three municipalities (Week 1)

**Key Staff Participants:**
- Municipal managers/administrators

### 5.2 Data Validation

Local staff will review and validate:
- Critical asset inventories
- Infrastructure elevation data
- Historical flood information
- Planned developments and projects

This ensures analysis reflects local knowledge and current conditions.
